926,0,2,-1,28/7/2011,"This is a beautiful quaint little restaurant on a pretty street._f you're strolling through soho around lunchtime, this would be a great place to stop for a bite. I heard the reviews about the lamb sandwich, so I had to try it. I'm very happy that i did. Every single ingredient - from the bread to the onions and tomatoes, the lamb and the sauce - was delicious. These four stars are well deserved because of the tasty sandwich and great ambiance._ would recommend this place to anyone."

1161,1,2,-1,26/6/2012,I think it is a family run business which makes it even better in my book. The pizza is fantastic here and the service is always great. The vodka sauce and garlic crisps are real good too!
